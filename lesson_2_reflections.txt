Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: Git creates a database to internally store commits and file versions.
   You have to create a repository, because git operates on the repository and
   not directly on files.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: Unlike the working directory, the staging area contains only the files that are going to be tracked for changes (if commited).
   But it does not contain the files that are already tracked (these belong in the repository).
